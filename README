= !Auth_Yubico PHP class =

The Yubico authentication PHP class provides an easy way to integrate
the Yubikey into your existing PHP-based user authentication
infrastructure.  Installation is simple using PEAR.

== Status and Roadmap ==

The module is working.  Several items have been identified that needs
to be implemented before it can reach production quality.  Search for
TODO in Yubico.php.

The development community is co-ordinated via Google Code:

  http://code.google.com/p/php-yubico/

The license for php-yubico is the revised BSD license.  See the file
COPYING for more information.

== Installation ==

Make sure your PHP installation supports curl, and that you have
installed PEAR.  Install the component by invoking:

{{{
  wget http://php-yubico.googlecode.com/files/Auth_Yubico-1.5.tgz
  pear install Auth_Yubico-1.5.tgz
}}}

== Example usage ==

The class is easy to use, in an HTML *.php file you invoke it as
follows:

{{{
<?php
 require_once 'Auth/Yubico.php';
 $otp = "ccbbddeertkrctjkkcglfndnlihhnvekchkcctif";

 # Generate a new id+key from https://api.yubico.com/get-api-key/
 $yubi = &new Auth_Yubico('42', 'FOOBAR=');
 $auth = $yubi->verify($otp);
 if (PEAR::isError($auth)) {
    print "<p>Authentication failed: " . $auth->getMessage();
    print "<p>Debug output from server: " . $yubi->getLastResponse();
 } else {
    print "<p>You are authenticated!";
 }
?>
}}}

== Demo page ==

how you may use the package.  The source code is available from:

There is also a complete example site to demo one-factor and
two-factor mode.  It requires a database to store the username and
passwords.  Database schema is in example/db.sql and configuration for
the database needs to go into example/config.php.
