NOTE: This project is deprecated and is no longer being maintained. For more information and guidance on how to implement Yubico OTP support in applications, see https://status.yubico.com/2021/04/15/one-api-yubico-com-one-http-get/.

The Yubico authentication PHP class provides an easy way to integrate
the Yubikey into your existing PHP-based user authentication
infrastructure.  Installation is simple using PEAR.

The development community is co-ordinated via
https://github.com/Yubico/php-yubico[the Github project].


=== Installation ===

Make sure your PHP installation supports curl, and that you have
installed PEAR.  On Debian/Ubuntu systems:

  $ apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5 php5-curl php-pear

Install the component by invoking:

  $ wget https://developers.yubico.com/php-yubico/Releases/Auth_Yubico-latest.tgz
  $ pear install Auth_Yubico-latest.tgz

=== Usage ===

NOTE: Make sure that you have read https://developers.yubico.com/OTP/Libraries/Using_a_library.html[Using a YubiKey OTP library] before continuing.

This is an example of how you can use the `Yubico.php` inside an HTML *.php file:

[source, php]
-----------
<?php
 require_once 'Auth/Yubico.php';
 $otp = "ccbbddeertkrctjkkcglfndnlihhnvekchkcctif";

 # Generate a new id+key from https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey
 $yubi = new Auth_Yubico('42', 'FOOBAR=');
 $auth = $yubi->verify($otp);
 if (PEAR::isError($auth)) {
    print "<p>Authentication failed: " . $auth->getMessage();
    print "<p>Debug output from server: " . $yubi->getLastResponse();
 } else {
    print "<p>You are authenticated!";
 }
?>
-----------
